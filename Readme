This project explores tumor cell motility to identify aggressive subpopulations in breast and ovarian cancer. Using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, we track cells under different treatments (e.g., HGF/SF activation or inhibition) and extract detailed kinetic and morphological features.

We built a computational pipeline combining image analysis, deep learning, and clustering to map and interpret cellular behaviors.

                                                     Pipeline Overview
Segmentation & Tracking:
Performed using Cell-ACDC on live-cell NIR fluorescence images.

Feature Extraction:

Morphokinetic features via PyBatch scripts

Protein expression levels across channels

Time-Series Embedding:
Motility time-series are processed using TASC (a Time-Series Autoencoder for Single Cells), enabling representation learning of dynamic cell behavior.

Clustering:

We apply DBSCAN and K-Means on the TSFM embeddings

Clusters reveal subpopulations with distinct motion profiles and aggressiveness levels

Validation:
Our results are compared with the Imaris commercial analysis platform to validate accuracy and biological relevance.
