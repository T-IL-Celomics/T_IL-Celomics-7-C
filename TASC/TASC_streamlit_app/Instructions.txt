# TASC GUI – User Instructions

## 1. Installation

- Install [Anaconda/Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/) if you don't already have it.
- Open a terminal/command prompt in the project folder.
- Create and activate the environment:
    conda create -n tasc-env python=3.8
    conda activate tasc-env
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## 2. Running the GUI

### Option A: Using the batch file (Windows)

- Double-click `TASC.bat` to launch the GUI.
  (This will activate the `tasc-env` environment automatically.)

### Option B: From command line (all OS)

- Run:
    conda activate tasc-env
    streamlit run TASC_GUI.py

## 3. Using the GUI

- The browser will open automatically.
- Upload or select your data file as prompted.
- Follow on-screen instructions to configure experiments, features, clustering, etc.
- Click “Run Analysis” to begin.
- View results, figures, and statistics.
- For best results, check your data matches expected column names:
    - 'Experiment', 'PC1', 'Parent', etc.

## 4. Saving/Exporting Results

- **To save your analysis as an HTML file:**  
  - Use the [SingleFile extension](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile) in Chrome or Firefox to capture the Streamlit session as a complete HTML file.
  - If your analysis contains large tables, these tables are also exported to a separate HTML file (since saving everything in one page can make the HTML unscrollable).
  - After saving, check your download folder for both the main HTML and the tables HTML file.

## 5. Tips

- For large datasets, use a machine with at least 8GB RAM.
- The GUI detects and uses GPU for Autoencoder/PCA if available.

## 6. Troubleshooting

- If you get errors, check:
    - Data columns and formats
    - Dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
    - Try restarting your browser or running `streamlit run TASC_GUI.py` again
