# TASC GUI – User Instructions

## 1. Installation

- Install [Anaconda/Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/) if you don't already have it.
- Open a terminal/command prompt in the project folder.
- Create and activate the environment:
    conda create -n tasc-env python=3.8
    conda activate tasc-env
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## 2. Running the GUI

### Option A: Using the batch file (Windows)

- Double-click `TASC.bat` to launch the GUI.
  (This will activate the `tasc-env` environment automatically.)

### Option B: From command line (all OS)

- Run:
    conda activate tasc-env
    streamlit run TASC_GUI.py

## 3. Using the GUI

- The browser will open automatically.
- Upload or select your data file as prompted.
- Follow on-screen instructions to configure experiments, features, clustering, etc.
- Click “Run Analysis” to begin.
- View results, figures, and statistics.
- For best results, check your data matches expected column names:
    - 'Experiment', 'PC1', 'Parent', etc.

## 4. Example Run

An example run is included in the repository.
You will find a sample input files (1.summary_table.xlsx , 2.TASC_pickles folder which contains rawdata.pickle and rawdatagraph.pickle) and the corresponding expected outputs (TASC_GUI.html , tables_report.html , wasserstein_heatmap.png , tukey_results.xlsx) .

To try it:
    Launch the GUI as described above.
    When prompted, select the sample input files and GUI inputs as configured in the run example.
    Run the analysis to see how results should look.

## 5. Saving/Exporting Results

- **To save your analysis as an HTML file:**  
  - Use the [SingleFile extension](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile) in Chrome or Firefox to capture the Streamlit session as a complete HTML file.
  - If your analysis contains large tables, these tables are also exported to a separate HTML file (since saving everything in one page can make the HTML unscrollable).
  - After saving, check your download folder for both the main HTML and the tables HTML file.
  - To download any table shown in the GUI, hover your mouse cursor over the table. A small toolbar will appear in the top-right corner of the table. Click the first icon from the left to download the table as a CSV file.

## 6. Tips

- For large datasets, use a machine with at least 8GB RAM.
- The GUI detects and uses GPU for Autoencoder/PCA if available.

## 7. Troubleshooting

- If you get errors, check:
    - Data columns and formats
    - Dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
    - Try restarting your browser or running `streamlit run TASC_GUI.py` again
