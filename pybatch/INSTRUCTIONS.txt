PyBatch Batch Analysis GUI - Quick Start

1. Prerequisites
   - Windows PC (Excel installed for Imaris files)
   - Python 3.8+ (use Anaconda if possible)
   - All dependencies in requirements.txt

2. Installation
   a. Open Anaconda Prompt or CMD.
   b. Navigate to the app folder.
   c. Create a new environment:
        conda create -n pybatch-env python=3.8
        conda activate pybatch-env
   d. Install dependencies:
        pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Launch the App
   - Option A: Double-click pybatch.bat
   - Option B: Run manually:
        streamlit run pybatch.py

4. Using the GUI
   - Use the sidebar to select files and set analysis parameters.
   - Follow on-screen prompts to upload data and run analysis.
   - Plots and tables will display in the browser.
   - Export results as PDF, Excel, or HTML as needed.

5. Exporting Reports
   - To save a summary or the current view as HTML, use the SingleFile browser extension, as the full page export may not scroll.
   - Tables are saved in a separate HTML file for better accessibility.

6. Troubleshooting
   - If Excel-related errors occur, ensure Excel is installed and closed before launching PyBatch.
   - For Streamlit errors, try restarting the app or your browser.
   - To reset session data, refresh the browser page.

7. Batch File Usage
   - `pybatch.bat` launches the app in the correct environment (`tasc-env` or your custom environment).
   - Edit the batch file if your environment name differs.
